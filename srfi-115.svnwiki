== SRFI-115: Scheme Regular Expressions

This egg provides the SRFI 115/R7RS-large regular expression library
designed by Alex Shinn. It is mainly a layer on top of [[(chicken
irregex)]]. While SRFI 115 is very similar to irregex, changes to
naming and procedure design make the two libraries incompatible.
With this egg, programs using the SRFI 115 syntax can run on CHICKEN
without changes.

See the [[https://srfi.schemers.org/srfi-115|SRFI]] for extensive
documentation of the library.

== Limitations

The regexp decompiler {{regexp->sre}} isn't provided. There seems
to be no way to implement this on top of (chicken irregex).

Since (chicken irregex) doesn't support Unicode yet, this library
doesn't support the {{grapheme}}, {{bog}}, {{eog}}, or {{w/unicode}}
SRE elements. Using any of these in an expression will raise an error.
These parts of the language may be supported in future versions.

{{w/nocapture}} is unsupported.
